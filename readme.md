## Architecture

![Logo](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zts5r.png)

The architecture of the quiz website can be broken down into the following components:

* *Backend* : The backend is built using Django and Django REST framework. It is responsible for handling all server-side logic, including serving the frontend, handling API requests, and managing the PostgreSQL database. The API is built using Django REST framework and exposes endpoints for user authentication, quiz questions, and quiz results.
* *Frontend* : The frontend is built using React and is responsible for handling all client-side logic. It uses Axios to make requests to the API and React Router for navigation. Tailwind is used for styling.
* *API* : The API is built using Django REST framework and exposes endpoints for user authentication, quiz questions, and quiz results. It uses Django's built-in authentication system to handle user registration and authentication.
* *Database* : The website uses a SQLlite3 database to store all data, including user information, quiz questions, and quiz results. The database is managed by Django's ORM.
